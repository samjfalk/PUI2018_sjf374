## Homework 10

### Assignment 1
The first portion of this assignment was done in class. The second portion I tackled with Sam Burns (shb395). We worked on the LR test and the using the manual likelihood to confirm the outcome together to determine the hypothesis and how to test. 

### Assignment 2
Once again, I worked with Sam Burns (shb395), though Sam has elicited help from Illyas at an earlier time which helped us on the chi square calculations. We also utilized the conversation the class had on slack for assistance. I had talked through some of the graphing aspects with Katharine Voorhees (kv871) and Mark Bauer (mb6203). 

Sam B. really helped me on understanding that using log function before graphing seems to work better than applying loglog=True on the plot. It was helpful to talk through the theoretical concepts to better understand the interpretations. 

Overall, this homework was meant to get more familiar with modeling in linear and polynomial ways with statsmodels package. Using the log and log likelihood added to the analysis to exacerbate the differences and compare models.
