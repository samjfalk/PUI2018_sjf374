### Homework 11

#### Assignment 1

Worked worked with Mei Guan and QY GOH. We all really struggled through this one, though each showed our own strengths. I have experience with sklearn, but unofrtunately didn't make it to that part. Working with arrays was more difficult than expected

#### Assignment 2

My feedback was very positive from Zoe. She mainly suggested I add more description to my plot. This can be seen below.
"My only suggestion is to add a caption that indicates where you obtained the data, your methods, a brief summary of your findings and analysis as well as some potential commentary on limitations of the plot, or how it can be used."


The graph shows the highlighted areas where the people to dog ratio is the highest. We can see that many parts of brooklyn and manhattan have a higher ratio than other areas. This data could be biased as it is only for people who register their dogs legally. There may be many dogs that are not registered.  

Stuy Town and Battery Park show the highest ratio of dogs to people. 

The data was obtained through the NYC open data portal. Links and Details of my methods can be seen in the assignment 2 notebook, but the main idea is I took the population and count of dogs from each neighborhood area and found the ratio of dogs to 100 people.
