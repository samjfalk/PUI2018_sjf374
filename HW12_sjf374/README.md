### Homework 12

##### Assignment 1

For assignment 1 I worked mostly alone, but asked questions of the professor in class. 

I was able to get through most of the notebook with using UInotebook as a guide (https://github.com/fedhere/UInotebooks/blob/master/timeseries/fourier.ipynb) and stackoverflow. One thing I did need help on, is selecting the stations with the most periodocity, which I asked in class for more clarification. I tried a couple of different methods, all of which lead to a few at the top of the list, but in the end had to make a decision about position 3 and 4. The dataset started at 194 weeks, but since this wasn't exactly 3 years, I used the "n" parameter for the numpy function Fourier Transform. 

##### Assignment 2

I worked with Sam Burns(shb395) and Sam Manzi (sm4372) --- all the Sam's working together. While working together we saw we varied in ways to load data. In the end we recieved advice from Cyrus Blankinship (cb4184) about how the dataframe should look after data cleaning.
