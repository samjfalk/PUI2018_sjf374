To set up my environment I had to do quite a few steps. The first of which, is setting up docker to mimic the PUI acceptable environment and pushing it up to Docker. Though some of my bash profile was previously configured, to set my environment up for this class I needed to add a couple short cuts through the alias and export functions. This allows for more efficient and consistent navigation and path naming in the command line.

To ensure that all was set up properly, I tested the new bash profile commands in the terminal to make sure they worked.
