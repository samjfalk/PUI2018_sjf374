This is for the week 3 homework

I worked side by side with Mei Guan on assignment 1 & 2

For assignment 1:
1. I created a test csv file in the remote repo

2. Pulled the file into my local directory
3. Completely deleted it from the local directory 
4. Pushed the deletion to my remote repo

For assignment 2:
First Mei and I looked for an NYC open set. We decided on the HIV/ AIDS data set that can be found here: 'https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/HIV-AIDS-Diagnoses-by-Neighborhood-Age-Group-and-R/dxnu-p2qd'. We loaded the data and found the basic gist of the data. We tried to initially graph HIV and AIDS counts without any manipulation, but realized the summary data and some NaNs did not apply. Once removed, the graphing was pretty straight forward.

For assignment 3:
First, I loaded the data in and inspected the dictionary though a series of iterations to find the information I needed. Once I had working code, I realized I needed to handle some possible errors- for example lower case input and wrong quantity of arguments. The basics of argument handling was covered in class and utilizing that code was useful. 

For Assignment 4:
This was an iteration on the previous assignment. The main difference was locating the next stop information and writing to a csv. The latter was covered in class. I tried to think of interesting ways to deal with the issues of no key information, and ended up with the 'try.. except' method.
