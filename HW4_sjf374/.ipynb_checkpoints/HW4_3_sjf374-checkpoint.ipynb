    "Follow the instructions on the slides as discussed in class. You are using the Z test to understand if a (fictitious) implementation of an alternative bus route for (fictitious) bus line X8 improves circulation. You know that the priginal bus rout for X8 took 36 +- 6 minutes (mean and standard deviation parameters of the population) and you have a table for the duration of a number of trips with the new bus routes. You do not need to import packages or run a pre-written Z test. The test is simply the formula below. What I am looking for here is: seeing a good Null/alternative hypothesis statement and treatment, with a clear Null and Alternative spelled out AND written out as a formula (spometihing - something >=0 for example), and a good interpretation of the Z value you obtain in terms of ability or inability to reject the Null Hypothesis.\n",

    "\n",
    "Acquire the data as needed, measure the statistics for the distribution (the mean of the sample and sample size) and plug them in the formula. The number you get, the Z statistics is the number of standard deviations away from the mean of your sample. Have you set a significance level ahead of time as you should have? Then you can compare that probability threshold with the probability of getting a result at least as extreme as the one you got for your Z test. Remember that the Z test is returning multiples of the standard deviation of a Normal distribution, so 1sigma corresponds to 68% inclusion, 2sigma 95%, 3sigma 99.7%\n",
    "\n",
    "The chapter of Statistics In a Nutshell that covers these topics is called Inferential statistics, including the Z test. It is chapter 3 in the hard copies of the book in the CUSP library, but it was moved to chapter 7 in the online book version which is in the link. Same content more or less."
