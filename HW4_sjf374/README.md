Week 4 Homework 

Assignment 1:

I worked with Mei Guan @MeiGuan on this assignment for the LogNormal and the final graphing - we informed each other on specific nuance of each distribution 

For this assignment, we iterated through 5 different statistical distributions to demonstrate the central limit theorem. The distributions we used were Normal (Gaussian), Poisson, Binomial, Chi Squared, and LogNormal. See below for steps taken for each:

1. create a graph a random set of 100 numbers that fall within the distribution used and consider a mean of 100 for the population
- this tended to not be a very smooth curve for the  distributions
2. create 100 of those same samples, but this time each has a random sample size of something between 10 and 2000
- this demonstrated that with larger samples the more likely a mean would be closer to the intended population mean
3. graph the histogram of these means
-this showed that aggregating multiple samples give a more accurate representation of the population


Assignment 2:

I worked with Mei Guan @MeiGuan and QY Goh @qygoh on this assignment. 

This assignment was to create a hypothesis based on citibike data, load in the data, do some EDA on the data and then set it up for the hypothesis to be tested. 

We decided to test if Sundays in June had a higher average daily trips than Sunday. 

	Null hypothesis: average trips per Sunday is less than average trips per Saturday in January.

	Alternative hypothesis: average trips per Sunday is more than or equal to than average trips per Saturday in January.

Initially we chose January 2016, but there was an entire week of data missing! So we went with June 2016. 

This analysis would probably be more beneficial on more data, but would take a lot more time waiting for the computer to process that many rows. 

QY informed a lot on forming the hypothesis and I aided in a lot of the cleaning and parsing of the dataframes.


It will be interesting to see what other people in the class test


Assignment 3:

I worked with Mei Guan @MeiGuan and QY Goh @qygoh on this assignment. Mei and QY were instrumental in making sure our hypothesis was accurate and detailed

This assignment was to take the hypothesis stated in class and test to see if the outcome was statistically significant. This was done through the following steps:

1. Expand on the hypothesis given with specific attributes and create an equation version of it
2. Download the sample of bus times provided by the professor
3. Find the sample mean, sample size, and same standard deviation
4. Plug the necessary variables into the Z Score equation and evaluate the outcome
