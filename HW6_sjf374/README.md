Homework 6 

Assignment 1:

Reviewed another classmate's @saraaita Citybike data, by following this prompt:

a. verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly

b. verify that the data supports the project: i.e. if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values (there is some flexibility here since the test was not chosen yet)

c. chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. You can refer to the flowchart of statistical tests for this in the slides, or here, or Statistics in a Nutshell.

Then pushed to a forked repository and created a pull request for @saraaita to complete on Tuesday night (10/16/2018).

As of writing this, no one has submitted a pull request for my repo.

Evaluated the Hard-to-Employ Study (https://www.mdrc.org/sites/default/files/What%20Strategies%20Work%20for%20the%20Hard%20FR.pdf) via a Z test and Chi Squared text for two two hypotheses:

NULL HYPOTHESIS: the % of former prisoners employed after release is the same or lower for candidates who participated in the program as for the control group, significance level p=0.

Recidivism NULL HYPOTHESIS: the % of former prisoners is convicted of a felony 1-3 years after release is the same or higher for candidates who participated in the program as for the control group, significance level p=0.05
