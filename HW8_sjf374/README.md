## Homework 8
### Assignment 1
I evaluated dogs per 100 people for my visualization. This was aggregated on Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTA). I combined three different datasets to accomplish this: NTA shape file (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Neighborhood-Tabulation-Areas/cpf4-rkhq), NTA population(https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/New-York-City-Population-By-Neighborhood-Tabulatio/swpk-hqdp), and dog licensing(https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/NYC-Dog-Licensing-Dataset/nu7n-tubp). 

It is likely that every person does not license their dog, so the outcomes of the analysis may be biased.

I ensured my colors were applicable to color blind people as well.

### Assignment 2
For this assignment, I worked again with QY and Mei since we did the initial assignment together for HW4. The Authorea report is here: The Authorea report is found at https://www.authorea.com/users/249380/articles/335460-hw8-assignment-2

We each contributed in different ways. For the graphs, we each made at least one of the graphs. QY did a great job keeping us organized and focused for the report.
