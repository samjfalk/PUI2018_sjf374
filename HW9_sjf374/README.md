### Homework 9

# Assignment 1
I reviewed two of my classmates graphs 
Manu Pathak, mp4515, pathakmanu
and
Yunhe Cui, yc3420, yunhecui 

The review can be seen in this repo, but also in their respective repositories.

# Assignment 2
I worked alone for this assignment. I used statsmodel to fit lines and graph those lines. 

I had a bit of difficulty on the WLS, though I believe I was able to nail it down in Assignment 3

# Assignment 3

For assignment 3, I mostly worked alone, Sam Burns (shb395) and I talked through some of the code as we were working.
